As far as I can see, the principal feature of the tradeoff (and the justification for using this term) is that in the mid-range of GC-content nucleotide and amino acid compositions are more or less unlinked (adjustment at synonymous positions is sufficient to account for the GC-content) but at the extremes this is no longer the case and amino acid composition trails the GC-content (e.g. preference for Arg over Lys in GC-rich genomes). As the authors point out, the tradeoff is a purely “compositional” phenomenon which is fundamental in the sense that it equally applies to all genomes regardless of any features of the respective organisms. In other words, this is a purely mathematical, “forced” feature of nucleotide sequence that accordingly is in a sense trivial. I do not mean this in a pejorative way: trivial or not it is useful to carefully describe the connections between GC-content and amino acid composition as the authors do in this paper. The interesting effects emerge at the interface of this compositional tradeoff with selection. The paper presents some such effects in particular the higher purine content in GC-poor genomes that apparently is selected for stabilization of DNA.

To me the most interesting question is: why do extremely GC-rich and extremely GC-poor genomes exist at all? It seems that such extremes should be selected against given the inevitable effect on the amino acid composition as per the tradeoff. What gives? The present paper does not address this question.
