This work, along with the back to back paper by Beiles et al., reports tests of the hypothesis that in Drosophila, TEs previously identified as adaptive by comparison of the frequencies of widely separated populations in America and Australia could be adaptive also on the microscale, namely, in the Evolution Canyon (EC) on Mount Carmel in Israel. The conclusion is that, in contrast to the significant differences detected previously on the macroscale, on the microscale, there was no significant difference between the TE frequencies in the populations on the two slopes of the EC, and hence no evidence that the TEs from the given set are adaptive. Obviously enough, the homogenization of the TE frequencies could be attributed to the gene flow caused by migration.

To the best of my understanding, the statistical analysis that is key to this study is solid. The authors prudently note that the results only pertain to a small subset of TEs and accordingly cannot rule out adaptive roles of other TEs on the microscale.
