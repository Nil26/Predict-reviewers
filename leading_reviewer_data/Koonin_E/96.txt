Ramakrishnan and colleagues predict a new family of bacteria class III nucleotide cyclases. The prediction is quite robust, I have easily verified it. They also analyze the genomic context of the DUF2652 which is compatible with cyclase activity even if not particularly important. Experimental validation of this prediction will be of interest, particularly, perhaps, because such a protein is encoded by Mycobacterium tuberculosis and other Mycobacteria.

The manuscript is much too long for a Discovery Note and not structured appropriately. It is my strong opinion that there is no need to expand this to a full research paper. The results are fully commensurate with the Discovery Note format, so I believe that the manuscript has to be shortened substantially, with most of the figures either dropped or moved to the supplement. Furthermore, the reported findings are more straightforward than a reader of the paper would be impressed to think. Indeed, the significant similarity of the DUF2652 proteins to adenylate cyclases is readily detected by the 2nd iteration of PSI-BLAST as well as HHPred. This is not to trivialize the finding which is indeed beyond the standard annotation pipelines. However, it is necessary to indicate that simple tools that are routinely used to perform more sensitive sequences analysis easily detect the relationship, so although the authors are certainly entitled to use their own software, it is not strictly necessary.
