This very lengthy, yet carefully and elegantly written article summarizes experimental data from the senior author's laboratory that is perceived to support the Rodin-Ohno hypothesis on the origin of the two classes of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases from complementary strands of the same gene. I expect this paper to become an important contribution to the literature on the origin of codon-dependent translation. It contains a plethora of interesting ideas and descriptions of ingenious experiments. After quite some thought, I have decided not to comment in specific detail on the Rodin-Ohno hypothesis and the validity of the presented argument in that regard. Again, Carter and colleagues present their argument in detail and with great care, so an interested and qualified reader will be able to judge it.
