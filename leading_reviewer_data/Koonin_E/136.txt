In this article that is appearing back to back with the article by Gonzalez et al., Beiles et al. address the same question, namely putative adaptive roles of TEs in the differentiation of Drosophila populations on the opposite slopes of the Evolutionary canyon on Mount Carmel. Beiles et al. investigate the same set of TEs as Gonzalez et al., and similarly fail to detect significant differences after the appropriate multiple test correction. However, they arrive to the opposite conclusion, on the basis of the observed moderate (not reaching statistical significance) differences. I do not seem to fully grasp the logic here. Beiles et al. indicate that the adaptive roles of TEs depend not simply on their frequencies but rather on the effects of the TEs on the expression of the specific adjacent genes. This is a fully plausible argument, I think this is indeed true. However, the argument misses the point which is not that these TEs are not adaptive; some of them well might be. The point is, simply, that the significant differences in the frequencies of 18 TEs observed between remote populations in America and Australia were not reproduced in the comparison of the populations from the two slopes of the EC. Thus, in this case, the appropriate null hypothesis, namely that the frequencies of the TEs are not significantly different and accordingly, there are no direct indications of their adaptive role on the microscale, could not be falsified.
