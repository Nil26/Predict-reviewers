This is quite an interesting short paper that reports a number of previously unnoticed twintrons and most importantly demonstrates their evolutionary conservation at considerable phylogenetic depths, with the implication of functional importance of the twintron structure itself. This is the major finding of the work, and it is certainly valuable. I am less enthusiastic of the two hypotheses proposed in the article, namely that twintrons could be an important intermediate along the path of elimination of U12 introns and that multiple protein isoforms produced by expression of twintron-containing genes might play a role in carcinogenesis. The first hypothesis, which is one of the main themes in the article, is of interest but I find the evidence quite limited. The authors might wish to expand the discussion. The idea about carcinogenesis, to me, is sheer, unwarranted speculation. The presence of additional splice variants in cancer samples might be caused by a variety of factors, above all the general deterioration of regulatory processes in tumors, and have nothing to do with carcinogenesis. I am not sure this is even worth a mention.
