This is an exceptionally lively article that challenges the common wisdom that eukaryotic Argonaute proteins can only use small RNA guides to cleave or regulate other RNAs. The recent demonstration that some of the prokaryotic Argonautes employ DNA guides prompts the authors to consider various scenarios under which Argonaute binding to DNA could be biologically relevant. It is particularly interesting that the amount of DNA-containing vesicles greatly increases in cancers, suggesting the possibility for important roles of Argonautes in tumorigenesis.

I agree with the authors that the apparent current consensus on the exclusive RNA utilization of eukaryotic Argonautes, despite the available biochemical data on DNA-binding, is based more on non-critically accepted dogma than on solid negative results. The possibility of DNA-related functions of eukaryotic Argonautes is important and certainly merits experimental investigation.

I should note that this article reads to me more like Hypothesis than a Comment. Furthermore, in my view, the structuring of the abstract into Background, Results and Conclusions is slightly misleading. The paper does not really report results but a hypothesis, so either an unstructured abstract or one divided into Background, Presentation of the hypothesis and Testing the hypothesis, would be more appropriate.
