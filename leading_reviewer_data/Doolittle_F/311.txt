This is a nice breezy review of the current state of microbial ecology and evolution. I very much like the Q and A approach, since it highlights disciplinary differences. It would be nice to see someone (not necessarily these authors, and of course not right now) rewrite the history of the last 50 years of molecular phylogeny (its whole history) in terms of the biases imposed on its leading practitioners by their scientific training. Would we have 16S rRNA as the hegemonic "molecular chronometer" had Woese not spent much of his early career studying the code, translation and the ribosome? Had that not happened, and had our thoughts about species and their relationships been guided more by developments in genetics and epidemiology than in phylogenetics and origins-of-life chemistry, would we be so keen to see meaning in any universal "Tree of Life"? Had microbiologists paid more attention to philosophers, and indeed to Darwin, would we still be asking ourselves what microbial species are? I like to imagine that we could somehow disentangle all the "facts" we know about microbes from the theories (including biological evolution) by which we understand such facts and the histories (of our science) that we use in presenting and arguing these theories. We would then lay just the facts out before someone entirely ignorant of and maybe even hostile to all the rest - a Martian perhaps, or some Republican presidential candidate - and ask them to come up with some useful generalities. It's fun (and good science) to try to figure out what these generalities might be.
