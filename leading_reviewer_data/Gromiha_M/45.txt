In this work, the authors utilized computational methods and experimental data to understand the auto inhibited state of TRIF. They have performed extensive computations including mutational analysis, docking, molecular dynamics simulations and normal mode analysis. Using the results obtained from the study the authors proposed that the N-terminal domain binds to the BB loop region of the TIR domain and binding of TRIF induce conformational changes, which disrupt the interactions between the N-terminal and TIR domain thereby exposing the BB loop and rendering it amenable for higher-order oligomerisation. The work is interesting and exhaustive to derive the conclusions. The manuscript is well written and necessary details are provided.

1. Different docking algorithms are used in the manuscript (say Cluspro and capsdock etc.). The consensus binding sites obtained with these programs could be discussed.
2. Likewise several modelling software are used to predict the proline-rich region between the N-terminal and TIR domain of TRIF, which utilize different techniques. The reliable models may be discussed along with available experimental data.
3. References should be properly formatted. Volume numbers are missing in several references.
