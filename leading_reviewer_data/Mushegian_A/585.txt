1. The authors use some simple and straightforward exploratory statistics to ask whether gene expression data from different platforms can be directly compared. They conclude that, as a general rule, the answer is no: though many tissue-specific gene expression values are positively correlated between two platforms, i.e., SAGE and Affymetrix oligonucleotide arrays, many others are not.

The authors list several reasons why this could be so, but pursue and provide evidence for only one hypothesis, namely that there are errors in assigning SAGE tags or Affy oligos to genes.

It is a useful note of caution to those who attempt to 'integrate' expression data, analogous to an advice to infer function and evolutionary relationships of genes/proteins from their sequences and not the keywords in the FASTA definition lines. The need to know which genes are being examined is a necessarily quality control step that has to precede any gene expression analysis. If mistakes are found, they have to be corrected in order to make biological inferences. Unfortunately, this work does not provide much more than some support to this quite self-evident statement. In my opinion, the article is neither a novel scientific observation nor even a technical advance.

2. On the other hand, I would be extremely curious to know whether there are bona fide genes that consistently show poor cross-platform correlation of expression levels, and whether this, together with the knowledge of biases of Affymetrix and SAGE, could be used to infer something interesting about gene regulation.
