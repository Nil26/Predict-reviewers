The study by de Crecy-Lagard and co-authors pinpoints the DUF71/COG2102 asthe most likely archaeal/eukaryotic ATP-dependent diphthine-ammonia ligase,the so far unaccounted-for enzyme in the pathway of diphtamide biosynthesis, which pathway is responsible for the formation of unique derivative of the conserved histidine within the translation elongation factor 2. A distinct subfamily of this protein family appears to play another role in bacteria and a subset of archaea, most likely in the salvage of an intermediate of cobalamine biosynthesis. The evidence presented in the paper consists of genome context information, sequence-structure prediction and the data from yeast concerning gene expression and chemical-genomics profiling. Taken together, the evidence seems compelling to me. The data from yeast represent partial functional validation of predictions made for prokaryotes. I would recommend only to tone down the suggestion that all this is a “novel paradigm” in analysis of gene function: researchers have been inferring gene functions from phenotypes, as well as from directly detected changes in genotype, for a long, long time, and the current study is a logical extension of these approaches. What is different in the last 15 years is that we can compare these properties across many species with completely sequenced genomes; but even this is a logical extension of the previous work (compare, for example, with work from Yanofskyand Jensen labs on biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids) - it was not any prescription of a previous scientific paradigm that constrained the work, but rather the lack of the data.
