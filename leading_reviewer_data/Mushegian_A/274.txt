The manuscript by Povolotskaya et al. puts forward a simple model of nucleotide substitutions in the stop codons in bacteria, and tests it against the genome-wide data. One of the main conclusions is that TAG may be globally suboptimal, with each of the remaining two codons turning out more fit under different values of GC content.

One biological explanation of these data may be in the phenomenon of overlapping ORFs in bacterial operons. TAG is the only codon that does not accommodate a minimal overlap, whereas TAA can give one kind of stop-start codon overlap (TAATG) and TGA even two kinds (ATGA and TGATG). Perhaps if the authors restricted their sample to the termination codons in the last (or only) genes in operons, they would see much less difference between fitness of those two and TAG?
