I studied the paper focusing on model description and analysis. In my opinion, the system involving competition of polymerases and other factors for binding sites is quite interesting and the solution may be importance for the applications. Without getting into technicalities, I would like to note two points.

1. Presentation. In the current manuscript, the model can be best understood if the paper is read backwards. It is first stated why the model is needed (which is obviously important), then what are the predictions of the model, and finally how the model is constructed. In my opinion, the clearest way is to describe model's background, then list the hypotheses of the model and the resulting equations (all this as Methods) and finally the results of application of the model, possibly validated using simulated data. Currently, model assumptions are (if I am not missing something) buried within the body of the paper, which makes it difficult to follow.

2. Mathematical framework. It seems to me that the framework of queuing theory with multiple tasks reaching multiple service stands and competing for service is quite adequate. This framework leads to formulation in the form of Markov chains. Even if the final model involves simplifications (which is quite difficult for me to decide considering the current manuscript), anchoring it in a uniform mathematical formalism seems to make sense.
