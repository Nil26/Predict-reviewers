This short paper seems to be an interesting addition to the field of estimation of affinities of transcription factors to binding sites in gene promoters (or elsewhere in the genomes). The idea is to use the Boltzmann formula for binding probabilities, but instead of using the the coefficient beta of the form beta = 1/(RT) (as done in the original paper by Alamanova et al.), to tune it so it optimizes the ROC curves wrt the area under the curve (AUC). This has resulted in quality improvements and made the probability weight matrices (PWM) obtained comparable to those available from TRANSFAC, which are sometimes considered gold standard. In my opinion, the method, although not necessarily optimal, provides good to very good PWMs, but first of all a methodology of constructing PWM, also applicable in other circumstances. My technical comments are summed up in the “Recommendations to Authors”. 1. I am not sure how the methodology is affected by overfitting and how effective the 10-fold cross-validation is. Usually, the data set at researcher’s disposal is split into training and validations sets. The method is trained on the training set and validated based on the validation set. It is a rule it performs worse on the latter. Might the authors at least discuss this issue? 2. I understand that TRANSFAC is used for validation. How different is it from the training date set with respect to the characteristics of the sequences investigated? 3. The Discussion might provide more specific information on other applications of the methodology developed in the manuscript.
