In the transcription factor literature, there is a significant number of papers concerning spatial organization of AR activity within the nucleus, leading to effects such as hyperspeckling (see the attached paper by van Royen et al. 2007 from Houtsmuller's laboratory [98]). Are there cancer-specific modifications of such organization which might have anything to do with altered expression of AR-dependent genes?
