In this manuscript, the authors analyze a set of microbial rhodopsin sequences (including some that they amplified for this study from an environmental sample), and demonstrate that there is a new clade of sensory rhodopsins that is basal, with high bootstrap support, and that includes sequences from a surprisingly broad phylogenetic range (including one archaeal and three bacterial phyla). This distribution is interesting because previous studies of sensory rhodopsins have found them primarily in the Euryarchaeota and in the Bacteroidetes.
The methods are generally sound except that the taxonomy of the sister groups to the new clade is poorly resolved (i.e. non-significant bootstraps), and it would be reassuring if the split were confirmed using other phylogenetic methods besides likelihood (e.g. distance or Bayesian methods) before the new set of sequences was claimed as distinct.
Additionally, although the patchy phylogenetic distribution is suggestive of horizontal gene transfer, formal methods (of which several exist) should be used to confirm HGT as opposed to other factors that can lead to gene/species tree incongruence
