In this manuscript, the authors unite several families of putative transmembrane hydrolases into one superfamily using similarity search methods, specifically iterated PSI-BLAST. The superfamily contains several protein families of unknown function, providing a clear hypothesis concerning the function of these new members (although no experimental data are provided for validation). Overall, the paper is competently written and executed, though not especially groundbreaking. One puzzle is that the authors use iterated PSI-BLAST rather than profile-profile techniques such as COMPASS, which might be worth commenting on as the same group has previously argued that profile-profile methods provide substantially better results than sequence-profile matching, especially for detecting similarities in highly diverged protein families. The technique is also similar to the Shotgun algorithm from Patsy Babbitt's lab and implemented in some of our own software, which the authors might consider citing (although the approach is straightforward and has likely been independently invented many times).
It would be interesting to compare an explicit phylogenetic tree with the clans output shown in Figure 1. Doug Theobald, now at Brandeis, developed a method for converting COMPASS profile-profile significance scores into a phylogenetic tree (PMID 16266719) which it might be interesting to use here.
The discussion of the relationships among protein families and conclusions generally seem appropriate, and the manuscript should be a useful contribution to the literature, especially if specific experimental tests could be proposed that would confirm the function of the unknown protein families and if the results could be confirmed with the additional methods suggested above.
