I am a big fan of the study system selected by the authors: the bi-parental mitochondrial transmission in mollusks. The recent evolution of a male-inherited mitochondria, and an apparent lack of a cross talk of the male and female lines, provides a wonderful model for studying the evolution and function of mitochondria.
The authors study one of the crucial aspects of the male-transmitted mitochondria, to which degree the male mitochondria differs in expression from its female counterpart in different gametes, finding some differences. While I cannot attest to the experiments, it appears that it is one of the important questions that can be addressed in this system.
While the authors provide a good general overview of the issues involved (ROS, Muller’s ratchet, etc.), I think that the Conclusion section misses a chance to succinctly summarize their main results.
Also, given that the authors discuss issues of selection in the mitochondrial lineages, I was disappointed to see that there was no sequence analysis performed on the relatively large number of sequences of both male and female mitochondrial available in GenBank. The authors could have tested directly the strength of selection (measured by dn/ds, for example) in male versus female, versus exclusively female mitochondrial lineages.
Minor points:
“Of course, no implication for male-transmitted mtDNA viability was ever taken into consideration” – Change to “was never”
