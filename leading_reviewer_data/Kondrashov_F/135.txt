Review of Gonzalez et al. titled “Lack of population differentiation patterns of previously identified putatively adaptive TE insertions at microgeographic scales.” This is a simple manuscript detailing a straightforward analysis of the data contained in a back-to-back submission by Beiles and colleagues. It is, therefore, inherently linked with the other manuscript and the decision on these two manuscripts should be taken jointly. Figure 1 of the present analysis is most convincing – there do not appear to be any differences in the allele frequency of TE elements in D. melanogaster caught on the North or South slope of the Evolution Canyon. This result appears to apply to TE elements identified previously as either neutral or adaptive on much larger geographical scales. Neither do there appear to be any significant outliers with the author’s conclusion being that there is no evidence towards any of the TEs providing a selective advantage in one population versus the other. My opinion is that this analysis is solid and the manuscript best describes the data. However, I do not see how it would be possible to publish the present manuscript without the publication of the manuscript by Beiles et al., since they are the ones that have collected the data.
