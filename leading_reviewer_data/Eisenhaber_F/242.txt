This work is a pretty nice continuation of the series of articles by Aravind et al. gene function hypotheses/discoveries are presented in the meticulous combination of sequence-analytic findings and hints from the experimental biological literature. Starting with the serendipitous observation of two PFAM domains with unknown functions showing some HHpred-derived similarity to the PIWI/AGO model, the authors show that two divergent subfamilies of PIWI/AGO in the bacterial world and among eukaryotes do exist. Lots of additional information with regard to 3D structural details, binding properties, domain evolution, etc. is derived with the classical sequence-analytic procedures and many of these conclusions can be validated experimentally.
Given the very nicely written main text, the summary reads like an unloved extra, apparently composed after the authors were tired from putting together text and figures. I suggest to go carefully through the text and complement the summary with all the detailed conclusions about the two new subfamilies.
Further, the authors mention some “KM” who analyzed the data (in “Authors” contributions”); yet, this person is not listed among the authors.
