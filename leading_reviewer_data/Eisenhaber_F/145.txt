This review is the result of joint effort by Birgit Eisenhaber and Frank Eisenhaber. The proposed MS about the central dogma of molecular biology provides a welcome re-consideration of the dogmatic presentation of the matter in textbooks. It was a pleasure to read the text and it sparked a ping-pong of arguments between us. First, it is a good idea to put the central dogma into one row with fundamental physical laws of exclusion and conservation and to look for the justification at the physical and not so much at the biological level. The second idea of seeing the problem in the digital-analogue transformation context is yet another intellectual breakthrough with the implied need for readout from fully denaturated protein chains. We wish to emphasize the additional thought that the way back from proteins to nucleic acids is also blocked by the problem of non-uniqueness (Nichteindeutigkeit), the disambiguation of many possible return paths. First, one AA is represented by several codons. They might not differ in their translation values but they affect expression fidelity at both transcription and translation. Should the cells learn how to measure relative expression or to amplify a gene with reflection of all observed changes (including the inclusion into appropriate expression frameworks)? Further, there might be several isoforms and also mutations at the same site in the same protein in the same cell. How to resolve this ambiguity, again by finding the more frequent mutant? Third, the protein experiences lots of PTMs in its life time including those who change the sequence itself. Latest, the connection to the original gene gets lost at the level of proteolytic maturation and AA identity changing chemistry.
