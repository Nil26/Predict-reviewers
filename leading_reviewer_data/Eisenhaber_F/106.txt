The effort of the author to suggest the consequences of the Columbian Exchange for the human genome evolution is laudable and deserves support. The scientific question of how the genomes of many today almost extinct native American peoples survive as admixtures in genomes of European and African origin is of great importance form the evolutionary and historical point of view. Although I do fully agree with the general assessments, conclusions and proposals by the author, I am asking myself whether, at this preliminary point of time, we can speculate plausibly about certain new world characteristics that the natives were better adapted to compared with the arrivals from the other side of the Atlantic Ocean. For examples, have there been any infections/parasites originating from America that represented a major problem for the colonizers and their imported slaves?
The process of admixture as evolutionary process to gain fitness might be contrasted with the consequences of the process of (self-)isolation of populations as it is known, for example, for certain religious groups and heavily stratified societies (see the Indian caste system: “Genomic reconstruction of the history of extant populations of India reveals five distinct ancestral components and a complex structure” Basu et al., PNAS (2016) doi: 10.1073/pnas.1513197113). It would be interesting to study whether at all or to which extent increasingly inbred mating might have detrimental effects on the populations’ fitness.
