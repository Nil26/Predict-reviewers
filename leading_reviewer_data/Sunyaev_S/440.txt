This is an interesting study of genetic variation in bison. The authors characterized variation in the European bison and American wood and plains bisons using the BovineSNP50 Illumina Genotyping BeadChip. I have three comments listed below: 1)The manuscript seems to suggest that the observed small number of SNPs from the BovineSNP50 chip segregating in the bison population reflects a population bottleneck. However, the authors measured the level of shared polymorphism between bison and cow rather than the overall levels of variation in bison. The level of shared polymorphism has a more complex relationship with Ne and also depends on other parameters (for the theoretical treatment see Clark AG. Neutral behaviour of shared polymorphism. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1997 94:7730-4.) Thus, a more sophisticated discussion of the observations would be appropriate instead of simply stating the low level of variation and, subsequently, Ne.

2) The manuscript would benefit from the analysis of allele frequency distribution (excess of high frequency variants may be suggestive of a bottleneck) and FST between the analyzed populations.

3) Is it possible to quantify the improvement of breeding strategies using genotyping instead of pedigree data?
