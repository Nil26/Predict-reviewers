This manuscript offers a framework to evaluate remote homology by focusing on positions critical to protein folds. It combines HMMER search with methods for predicting disordered regions. The method has been successfully validated and implemented as an online tool. This development is of interest and the tool is potentially useful. As a minor comment, the paper can be written in a more economical and focused way. A shorter title may also be better.
