The manuscript contains a speculative argument that widespread horizontal gene transfer in prokaryotes is an adaptation allowing them to preserve long-term evolutionary memory that would otherwise have been quickly erased by rapid gene turnover.

This view goes along with my recent "Home Depot" model of prokaryotic evolution (S. Maslov, S. Krishna, T. Y. Pang, and K. Sneppen, "Toolbox model of evolution of prokaryotic metabolic networks and their regulation", in press (2009)). In our model prokaryotic genomes are constantly replenished from a common repository with entire metabolic pathways. This process can be compared to constantly buying tools in a hardware store (hence the "Home Depot" metaphor) only to return them once the project is over.

From my standpoint, this manuscript would greatly benefit if authors would accompany their verbal argument with a quantitative model. The model does not have to be realistic it just needs to clearly make the main point of the argument that prokaryotic world would collapse without some sort of gene exchange with a mutualized gene pool. Do authors expect a sharp error-catastrophe-like phase transition *in the absence* of horizontal gene transfer? What numerical constant is best suited to quantify this transition (akin to the number of mutations per genome per generation for error catastrophe)? What is its (approximate) range in prokaryotes? In the section "Testing the hypothesis" authors repeatedly refer to their earlier work (Ref. [27]) without adequately explaining even the basic ingredients of this earlier model. This section needs to be significantly expanded in the revised version of the manuscript.
