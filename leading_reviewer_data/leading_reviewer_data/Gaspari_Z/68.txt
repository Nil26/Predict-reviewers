The manuscript describes a novel set of pKa values for peptides and proteins. The set can be used to estimate the isoelectric point of these macromolecules. The problem is of importance in protein/peptide studies and improvements in the pKa data sets used can be useful.
Major recommendations:
-It is really interesting that the prediction works better for prokaryotic than for eukaryotic proteins. Can the author perform a bit more detailed analysis on this topic besides pointing out the role of PTMs? Do the worst outliers exhibit characteristic amino acid distributions? for example, eukaryotic proteomes are abundant in intrinsically disordered proteins for which the peptide data set might yield better results in some cases.
-It could be interesting if the author could give any further insights into the variations of the pKa values in the sets and especially the divergence of the newly suggested values relative to those in the literature. There is already a discussion of this in the manuscript just before the Conclusions section but as it is both an important and an interesting aspect, the manuscript might benefit from a more detailed analysis of this question.
A short description of the origin of the data sets used could also be helpful for the reader.
Minor recommendations:
-The author states that when multiple data were available for the isoelectric point, the average was taken. It would be nice to know how divergent these data were and whether the author has any hints on whether this affects the performance in any detectable way.
-In the 10-fold cross-validation process, how divergent were the resulting pKa sets that were averaged? What is the relation of this divergence to the diversity in the other data sets?
-Please provide a short explanation (in the Methods section) of the asterisked comments for Table 4 and Additional file 1: Table S3 (e.g. why the Sillero terminal pKa values were chosen to complete for the Dawson data set).
Minor issues
-The language of the manuscript needs careful revision. Most of the concepts can be deduced from the present version but the phrasing should be done with more care. So, although I think that the paper can be understood in its present form, I strongly recommend extensive language editing before final publication. Some examples: - “nine parametric model” for me would mean nine distinct models which are all parametric. Maybe the term “nine-parameter model” would be more appropriate (meaning a single model with 9 parameters). - “Basin-Hopping”: as this does not refer to names, simply “basin-hopping” can be written. - page 8, lines 203 and 233: instead of positively and negatively charged macromolecules, the author means residues here?
-For the additional FASTA files some explanation of the information in the headers would be welcome.
