The importance of bacteriophage contribution to the evolution of bacterial genomes is increasingly recognized. Here Sassi and coworkers conclude that bacteriophages drive the evolution of the Mycobacterium abscessus complex. I find this appealing and credible idea but fail to see how the data presented in the manuscript, even assuming that the identification of prophages is accurate (no specific evidence of that is provided), support such a strong conclusion. I can agree that the authors demonstrate differences in the prophage content between the bacteria in the complex. Then, I suppose, the argument would be that the trees of the bacteria and phages are different, suggesting that there has been some exchange of prophages and individual genes. The robustness of the trees is a concern because the trees for phages can be notoriously difficult. But, even assuming they are correct, this argument seems to fall far short of the ambitious claim of the paper. It could be very helpful if the authors made an effort to carefully present their logic.
