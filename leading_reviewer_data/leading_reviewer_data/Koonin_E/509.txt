The driving force behind the emergence of the nucleus is a key aspect of eukaryogenesis. In this paper, JÃ©kely proposes a new idea, namely, that the evolution of the nucleus from the endomembrane system was driven primarily by the necessity to avoid the formation of hybrid ribosomes containing partly host and partly mitochondrial r-proteins. In my opinion, the general premises of this paper are correct. Indeed, there is every reason to believe, firstly, that the origin of the nucleus postdates mitochondrial endosymbiosis and, secondly, that the nuclear envelope evolved from the endomembrane system. It stands to reason, then, that the nucleus evolved under the pressure of selection for partitioning the genome from the cytosol, and that pressure was caused by the need to alleviate conflicts caused by the collision of host and mitochondrial components. I am inclined to think that, beyond this general connection, it might be futile to search for a single cause behind the origin of the nucleus. From my viewpoint, it is more reasonable to accept that multiple host-symbiont conflicts were at play. Avoidance of ribosomal chimerism, indeed, could be one of these, but so would be control of the damage caused by intron invasion, and there well could be multiple other factors.
