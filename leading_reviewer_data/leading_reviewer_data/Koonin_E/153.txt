Badyaev and colleagues explore a truly interesting evolutionary landscape where evolution of a metabolic network is intimately linked to the evolution of a highly visible phenotypic trait, the avian plumage coloration. The analysis is quite elaborate, and the conclusions, in particular, the explanation for convergent evolution of carotenoid pigmentation, seem important.

Yet, I have to confess that, at least to me, the manuscript is difficult to read, and I was unable to follow all the steps that led the authors to these conclusions. I wonder whether it might be possible to explain the connection between metabolic robustness and elaboration in simpler terms and/or in greater detail, perhaps using some diagrams to facilitate understanding. Also, it is not immediately clear to me how and where does this paper address the (dis)connect between microevolution and macroevolution.

Furthermore, would it be possible to explain, in specific terms, how do metabolic networks expand in birds. Given that birds do not appear to be prone to horizontal gene transfer, I suppose that this expansion involves gene duplication followed by neofunctionalization. Is this correct? Would it be possible to present specific cases? I think this would clarify the entire story. The situation with losses is more obvious but again, a specific description at the level of genes and enzymes would be helpful.

In short this is quite a substantial paper on an interesting subject but I think it could gain a lot from a more complete and specific presentation.
