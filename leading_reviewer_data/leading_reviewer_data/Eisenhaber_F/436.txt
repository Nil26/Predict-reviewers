1. Although the theory of sequence homology is general, our sequence-statistical criteria have only been proven for globular domains. Essentially, the conservation of an apparently random hydrophobic pattern that is necessary for composing the hydrophobic core of the globular structure serves as a strong criterion for fold conservation and this is the reason for a high score. For various non-globular segments that have amino acid compositional bias or simple repetitive patterns, sequence similarity does not necessarily mean homology. It is not rare that PSI-BLAST collects groups of proteins that just have transmembrane regions in common, especially if the inclusion cutoff is quite generous as in this work. This is relevant for the 10TM sugar acyltransferase family collection. Are there other arguments for homology than just the conservation of a few functional residues that are hypothesized to form an intramembrane active site? Are there observations of finding irrelevant proteins in the hit lists?
2. You write that most PC-esterases have at least a pair of conserved cysteines; "most" being a not very scientific determination. Can this conclusion be supported with quantification?
