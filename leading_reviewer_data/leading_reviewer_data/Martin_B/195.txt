Report form: Here David Penny talks about cooperation between molecules cells and organisms. He concludes that ”There must always be a very large number of macromolecules working together (cooperating) for any biological system to survive and to evolve but simultaneously there must be defense against ‘cheats’. I submit that his conclusion is not new but the path he took to get there is so the essay is a worthwhile contribution to the record. I will not get into a debate with the author on the accuracy of all the statements. For example we knew about the importance and abundance of gut microbes long before metagenomics. Nor will I debate historical aspects for example the word symbiosis was coined by de Bary on the basis of studies on lichens which are often a symbiosis of prokaryotes and fungi not just algae and fungi as stated. Nor will I comment on attribution for example Szathmary and molecular parasites or Forterre and akaryotes. Happily Penny points out several interesting papers that have appeared of late on quite a few different topics. Few of us will have seen them all so this is another very positive aspect of the paper which offers so many opportunities to dig in and debate but life is so short.
