Evolutionary Biology
Concept, Modeling, and Application

Preface

Since 1997, scientists of different disciplines who share a deep interest in evolutionary biology concepts, knowledge and application have held the Evolutionary
Biology Meeting at Marseilles in order to discuss their research, exchange ideas and
start collaboration. Lately scientists interested in the application joined the group.
We start the book with the meeting report that gives a general idea of the
epistemological posture of the meeting; this is followed by 22 articles.
These articles are, to my mind, a selection of the most representative talks, which
have been brought up during the 12th Evolutionary Biology Meeting at Marseilles.
We decide to sort out the articles in several categories: evolutionary biology
concepts and knowledge, concepts and knowledge modeling and concepts and
knowledge application. The reader will note that evolutionary application transcend
biology since two articles in the book show application of evolutionary biology
concept to economy and astronomy announcing other field of applications.
I would like to thank all the authors of the book, the meeting participants, the
sponsor-CNRS, Universite´ de Provence, Conseil Ge´ne´ral 13, Ville de Marseille and
GDR BIM.
I also wish to thank the staff of Springer for their cooperation and more
especially Andrea Schlitzberger for her considerateness.
Last but not least I wish to thank the ‘‘Association pour l’Etude de l’Evolution
Biologique’’ and the meeting coordinator Axelle Pontarotti whose outstanding
work enhanced both the quality and friendliness of the meeting
