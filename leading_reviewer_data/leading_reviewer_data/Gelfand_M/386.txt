The paper addresses an important problem of selecting a good similarity measure for comparing gene expression patterns. It does not provide definitive answers, but demonstrates correct approaches. The main conclusion, "the choice of a proper measure depends on the biological problem at hand" is difficult to argue against. The following comments are mainly of the discussion and editorial nature.

While the basic assumption, that homologous tissues in different organisms should be more similar in the terms of gene expression than tissues in one organism, is reasonable, some caveats are due. For instance, if the tissues in question are very close developmentally, one can easily expect concerted, organism-specific changes in expression. In fact, the papers results demonstrate exactly that.

The rat spleen and thymus are clustered by all measures (Fig. â€‹(Fig.1).1). The human spleen and thymus are clustered by some measures, and I think that clustering [(thymus_rat + spleen_rat) + (thymus_human + spleen_human)] should not be counted as an error, as opposed to a version with human spleen being an outlier: [((thymus_rat + spleen_rat) + thymus_human) + spleen_human]. Similarly, I'd assume that both versions [(muscle_human + heart_human) + (muscle_rat + heart_rat)] and [(muscle_human + muscle_rat) + (heart_human + heart_rat)] are biologically relevant, as opposed to [((muscle_human + heart_human) + muscle_rat) + heart_rat)]. Hence, the procedure of counting errors should not be limited to considering pairs of non-clustered homologous tissues, but should tale into account finer topological detail (as well as, maybe, branch length).
While this may go beyond the limits of the present study, I think it would be interesting to look into more detail into the cluster trees generated by different measures, and specifically, into what genes contribute most into different clusters, dependent on the expression patterns. At that, one should keep in mind that in each tissue we observe an averaged expression of genes from a mixture of quite different cell types. For instance, clustering of the spleen, thymus and the bone marrow may be related to the blood cells development, while clustering of the spleen, thymus and the pituitary gland may be caused by genes expressed in the gland tissue.

Some hint of analysis is given in the last paragraph of "Distance estimates". The overrepresentation of heart and muscle development genes is not surprising, given the robust clustering of these tissues in all trees. On the other hand, the statement that the Eucledian distance does not provide a functionally meaningful set: one can easily see blood cell development genes there (not surprising given spleen, thymus and bone marrow data) and neurological process (the sources for which is admittedly less clear: could it be the pituitary gland?)
