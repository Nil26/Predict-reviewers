In this manuscript, Pilpel and Rechavi make the clever connection between Darwinian and Lamarckian mechanisms and the famous Chicken and Egg paradox. This allows them to nicely frame the question of where does novelty ultimately arise: in the germ line or in the soma? Since the Modern Synthesis a century ago, it has been held that novelty arises as mutations in the germ line, however exciting research over the past few years has provided evidence that changes occurring in the soma can also be heritable across generations. I commented on an earlier version of this manuscript and am even more pleased with its current state. One limitation of the analogy that may be worth pointing out again is that under the chicken-first scenario, really only one cell – and not the entire organism - has the ‘chicken-phenotype’.

One issue that I feel is missing in the discussion is the role that any somatic epigenetic change plays in adaptation. In other words, are the changes necessarily of any consequence? If, through interaction with the environment, an adaptive somatic change may occur and become heritable, the details of such a mechanism would be extremely interesting. In a related note, the CRISPR system in bacteria can be said to be Lamarckian since the adaptive changes to the genome are inspire by the environment (the attacking viruses): did proto-chickens have a similar mechanism?

Finally, in the two paths imagined by the authors, why does an epigenetic mutation precede a somatic mutation? It seems plausible that there is a third path that simply starts with a somatic genetic change and leads to a germline genetic change.
