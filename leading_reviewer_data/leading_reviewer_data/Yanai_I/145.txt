In this short manuscript, Koonin argues that the most important aspect of the Central Dogma is that it forbids reverse translation. Koonin has previously written in this journal about the problem of evolving from an RNA-world to a nucleic-acid system coupled with a protein system, offering the anthropic principle as one solution. Here he notes that the transition was one from a digital information system to an analog one. This transition benefited from a wide range of variation thus leading to better fitness over time, however was also accompanied with the cost of broadly preventing a bidirectional flow of information. This historic compromise is now a central aspect of biology on Earth, and Koonin argues that for this reason the Central Dogma should indeed be considered central. I find this piece interesting and compelling; seeming obvious only because that is the hallmark of all good ideas once they are proposed. In particular, I am very happy to see Koonin take a concept that was developed by a molecular biologist and frame it in an evolutionary context. It urges me to think that other central biological concepts would benefit from such re-framing.
