A short article by D. Haft provides us with another beautiful illustration of the power of comparative genomic approach for pathway reconstruction and gene discovery. This study builds on top of a recently published analysis of widespread genomic distribution of pathways generating bacteriocins, short proteins containing oxazole and/or thiazole heterocycles. By combining highly sensitive profile-based search models with the analysis of genome context, D. Haft predicted the existence of a putative bacteriocin maturation pathway in an important group of Bacillus (B. anthracis and B. cereus). The most challenging aspect of this analysis was a "missing" bacteriocin precursor, which in all previously described cases was located in the same chromosomal cluster with genes involved in its posttranslational modification. A convincing prediction of a remotely located gene candidate for a novel version of protoxin characteristic of this group is the most impressive intellectual breakthrough of this elegant study. The identification of an uncalled gene encoding an ortholog of the "heterocycloanthracin" precursor in a chromosomal cluster with the maturation pathway genes in B. licheniformis strongly validated this ambitious inference. A unique and highly attractive feature of D. Haft's article is that it provides biologists with a mature hypothesis that may (and most certainly will) be immediately tested by a focused experiment.
