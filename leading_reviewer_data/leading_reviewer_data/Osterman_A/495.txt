The manuscript "Unraveling the biochemistry and provenance of pupylation: a prokaryotic analog of ubiquitination" by L. M. Iyer, A. M. Burroughs and L. Aravind conveys the most spectacular bioinformatics-based discovery. Everything about this short article is truly amazing, starting from its very modest size and as-a-matter-of-fact style of presenting a genuine intellectual breakthrough. Authors brilliantly combined comparative genomics, structural bioinformatics and biochemical reasoning to discover a novel enzymatic mechanism of tremendous biological importance. Although we are already quite spoiled by the scale of insightful functional inferences produced by bioinformatics and comparative genomics, this study constitutes a quantum leap into an entirely new dimension. The predicted mechanism is so obviously elegant that its "reduction to practice", which will inevitably follow very soon, will hardly add much to the story. In addition to establishing a new enzymology, the authors provided solid evidence that the physiological role of pupylation, at least in some bacteria, extends beyond tagging proteins to proteasomal cleansing. This observation opens a new line of studies that will likely follow. Finally, this paper provides an excellent tutorial in advanced bioinformatics and the most compelling illustration of its impact in biological discovery.

Do you believe that there is a specific terminal Gln deamidase working in TB? If yes, any candidates?
