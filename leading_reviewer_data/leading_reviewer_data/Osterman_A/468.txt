The excellent article by Makarova, Wolf and Koonin could be indeed termed Genomic Encyclopedia of Prokaryotic TAS-2 for the breadth and depth of coverage of this fascinating system over 750 prokaryotic genomes. However, the accurate cross-genomic projection of the presently known TAS components, no matter how challenging and important, is only one of the remarkable accomplishments of this study. By pushing the boundaries of predictive comparative genomics to a completely new level, the authors also substantially expanded a repertoire of known toxins and antitoxins. They developed a sophisticated workflow elegantly capturing the elusive and mysterious nature of TAS operons, which allowed them to predict dozens of previously unknown players and combinations thereof. This workflow (computational techniques and filters included therein) is yet another remarkable deliverable of this study, which will be inspirational and instructive for those who are chasing after other challenging protein families. The detailed analysis of the resulting monumental picture, a genomic distribution of thousands of TAS elements, provided new insights into their evolution, intra- and interspecies mobility and functional associations. No doubt, this single study provided a great starting point for dozens of experimental biologists to follow upon.
