This paper is a wonderful piece of detective work that at the same time synthesizes many separate observations and theories on the origin of the genetic code and tRNAs. I really found nothing in here that requires substantial comment or clarification, other than to say it is a thoroughly interesting read - real food for thought. The analysis of results of amino acid binding sites in vitro selected RNA aptamers is thorough, and the Fibonacci process-inspired model for the evolution of tRNAs is truly insightful and thought-provoking. Perhaps one of the most interesting points of this process is that it yields a very precise stepwise model wherein tRNAs can converge independently from unrelated short RNA aptamers that bind amino acids upon a common length (and structure), ultimately containing both operational and genetic codes.
