This is a strong, encyclopedic survey and analysis of a large and diverse family of important protein domain families. The search strategy was quite clever. Dealing with remote homologs is never easy and the authors did an excellent job in finding them and then proving their relatedness using extensive profile-profile comparisons and structural considerations. The results lay foundation for future experimental studies in this area, especially when existing domain models in public databases will be appropriately changed. I have decided not to list minor technical points, especially because 50 pages without line and page numbering are hard on a reviewer, and I have only a couple of suggestions to offer:

1. The title sounds as the authors have just discovered the HEPN domain, which is obviously not the case. There should be something in the title (e.g. “survey of”, “redefining”, “novel functions associated with” ) that correctly states their findings.

2. Better placement of the new results into the Pfam context would be helpful. HEPN is currently listed as a domain (PF05168) within the nucleotidyltransferase substrate- binding domain clan (KNTase_C, CL0291), not HEPN clan, as stated by authors.

Authors indicated that their searches retrieved proteins that belong to three families of this clan in addition to HEPN: DUF4145, DUF86 and “C-terminal domains of several polymerase β–superfamily proteins”. The Pfam clan also includes GlnD_UR_UTase, NTase_sub_bind, PaREP1, and DUF294_C domain families. Their relationship to authors’ results remains unclear: are they all “C-terminal domains of several polymerase β–superfamily proteins”? Regardless of the answer, this relationship should be better explained.
