The review summarizes advantages of using cloud computing for “big data” storage and analysis issues in bioinformatics. In general, it does a fair job on this front. However, disadvantages of clouds are not discussed in this review at all. For example, time-critical calculations, complex tasks that require data management (load balancing, fault tolerance issues, etc.) will not do well on clouds that lack the edge of advanced HPC architectures.
