Reviewer summary:
The paper is focused on modeling the clonal structure of driver mutations in leukemias. It is based on a previous model by the same group, which is augmented by new mutations appearing at random. The topology of the resulting clonal pedigrees is compared to literature data, notably ref. [12]. The results are plausible in that the collection of structures generated by the model matches that in ref. [12]. I enjoyed reading the paper, which is certainly sufficiently novel to be published.

Reviewer recommendations to authors:
1. The main difficulty I see at the current stage of development of the model is that the simulated mutations are not identified with any particular “real” drivers. At least some comments on the subject will be helpful.

2. The authors identified a plausible mechanism of selection of clones by assuming that faster clones are not seen in the patient population, since they lead to a sooner death, while on the other hand the slowest clones do not show since the patient may die of competing risks before he/she is diagnosed. It would be nice to see the sensitivity of this mechanism to changes in clone mutation rate distribution, for example.

3. I understand that once a mutation (= driver mutation?) arises, the clone it initiates survives. This is of course true only of some of the clones. The problem can be fixed by adjusting the rate of the Poisson process by the probability of non-extinction of the clone, as it was done for example in the models in Bozic et al. (2010) or Kimmel and Corey (2013). It would be interesting to know how such adjustment might change the effective mutation rates.
