Summary : The ms of Hur et al. describes a gene prioritization server designed for evaluating mouse knockout experiments. As the authors point out, general prioritization tools can not easily be used for mouse knockout data. The authorsâ€™ solution to the problem is to design a mouse-specific transcription factor network based on a variety heterogeneous data, and integrating it with another single nucleotide variant dataset. This extended network is used to prioritizing genes in a particular manner, taking in consideration the functional context.

Recommendations: This is a complex workflow which is not easily understood by the lay users, for instance it is not straightforward if a good performance is due the new data network, or the algorithm used by the server. In any case, the authors show that their prioritization method works better than other state/of/the art methodologies which were not explicitly designed for mouse experiments. The manuscript would benefit from the discussing some of the above issues, also it may me mentioned, if and to what extent the differences found between the various methods are statistically significant.
