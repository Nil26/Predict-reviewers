This paper makes a compelling argument for the autogenous evolutionary origin of the peroxisome. Although this was not a surprise given recent cell biological findings showing that peroxisomes grow from the endoplasmic reticulum, the autogenous origin of the organelle is now clearly backed by the systematic bioinformatic analysis of its proteome. Most interestingly Gabaldón et al. found that some components of the peroxisomal proteome (the Pex5 pathway) are evolutionary derivatives of the endoplasmic reticulum assisted decay (ERAD) pathway.

The paper is technically sound and well written, I only have a few comments.

1) I have a problem about how the authors define that a protein has eukaryotic origin. For example the Cdc48/Sec18/Pex6 family seems to have descended from archaebacterial AAA ATPases. What the tree shown in Fig. ​Fig.1A1A shows is rather that the multiplication of this ancestral ATPase leading to several paralogs was an eukaryotic event. So the protein family clearly has prokaryotic origin, it is the formation of distinct paralogs that occurred during eukaryote evolution. This should be explained better in the text and this group should be referred to differently, like 'originated by eukaryote-specific duplication'.
2) The reconstruction of the ancestral state of the peroxisomal proteome hinges on the accepted topology of the eukaryotic tree. If Kinetoplastids are not early branching but the root lies between animals and plants, then one would probably get a different picture. This alternative reconstruction should also be presented and/or the effect of tree topology on the results should be discussed.
3) Several of the eukaryote-specific Pex proteins are not discussed in the text. One is left wondering what could have been the evolutionary origin of these proteins. If it is not clear for most of them, this should be mentioned briefly.
