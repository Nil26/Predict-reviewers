This paper describes a novel software tool that searches for mRNA 5' sequence incompleteness at a large scale and the application of this tool for zebrafish mRNAs. Such an EST-based approach is important in order to improve mRNA completeness and the prediction of the correct translation start site in genome databases. The method described adequately addresses the problem of mRNA incompleteness in databases.

The description of the problem, the methods, and the three experimentally validated examples is somewhat lengthy and redundant. The methods section is also unnecessarily detailed and should be shortened. For example the section starting with "The Danio rerio EST subset was also downloaded from Entrez in GenBank format" contains trivial details about data download, concatenation, database formatting and local blasting. The methods section should focus on describing how the software developed by the Authors works.
