The authors identified signs of positive selection during human evolution in the Cernunnos protein. It is interesting given that certain mutations in the human gene lead to microcephaly. The authors speculate that positive selection in the gene may have contributed to increased brain size evolution in humans.

However, as discussed in the paper, loss of Cernunnos activity also leads to immunodeficiency in humans and it is equally possible that positive selection acted to modify immune functions during primate evolution. To decide between these two possibilities it may help to check in large-scale comparative expression datasets (e.g. Science 5566:340-3) whether expression levels of components of the XRCC4-Ligase IV complex changed in humans in the brain.
The proposed scenario for brain size increase only works if double stranded break repair is limiting during brain development. Is actually apoptosis regulated at the level of double-strand break repair? In other words even if impaired double stranded break repair can lead to apoptosis it may not mean that its increased activity can prevent it.
