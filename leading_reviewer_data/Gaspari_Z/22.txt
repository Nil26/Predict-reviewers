While the manuscript might be of interest to the statistics community, in its present form it seems to provide little biological significance. The paper describes how the sensitivity of different linear regression models changes as a function of the amount of anonymized data. The fact that drug-sensitivity data are used is merely a technical choice, the manuscript provides no novel insights and the obtained rank correlations (on real data) seem to be irrelevant even in the best cases.
It is not clear how the method relates to previously published ones (http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v32/n12/fig_tab/nbt.2877_T1.html?foxtrotcallback=true) and whether it is comparable to those at all.
The biological relevance of the bounding of the values and the omission of data in order to reduce the dimensions should also be justified. It is not at all trivial that these steps are allowed without losing relevant biological information and insights.
I recommend that the work should be presented in a way that allows the judgment of the biological relevance of the resulting analysis and the possible loss of information introduced by the transformations. It is highly desirable that the description of the approach includes a case with real data where both retaining the biological significance and the privacy issues can be clearly and effectively shown.
