The authors present interesting, if straightforward, analysis, and the paper may be published more or less "as is", provided misprints and minor inaccuracies are corrected.

The only serious problem is the use of PolyPhen for the identification of damaging mutations. The PolyPhen analysis is based to a large degree on distant comparisons. But as the authors themselves have shown in one of their recent papers, a mutation that is damaging in a protein may well be observed in a distant protein. Hence PolyPhen should underestimate the underestimate the number of damaging mutations.
The other problem is that it is not obvious that it is correct to treat the African population as a homogeneous one. In fact, the non-African variation could be expected to be smaller simply because non-Africans are descendants of one branch of Africans.
