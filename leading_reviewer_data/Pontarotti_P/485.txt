Rolain et al. report the complete sequence of a representative isolate of a Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus from a cystic fibrosis patient (name strain CF-Marseille) and have conducted a comparative genome analysis with the published sequences. This comparative analysis shows that the CF Marseille strain displays a similar core genome with other sequenced MRSA, with some apomorphism due to mobile elements and a new phage closely related to Phi ETA3. The bioinformatics and microbiologic analysis are robust and the paper is highly informative. I would, however, advise the author to write a short introduction on the origin of multi- antibiotic resistance and artificial selection (see for example Palumbi: Humans as the World's Greatest Evolutionary Force Science 7 September 2001: Vol. 293. no. 5536, pp. 1786 â€“ 1790 science.293.5536.1786). This will be helpful for the BD readers that are not specialists in the domain. An explanation of the role of virus (that do not encode for resistance antibiotic genes) in the emergence of antibiotic resistance is also necessary, as this role is not well explained for a non specialist.
